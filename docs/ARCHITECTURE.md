# EcoCatalyst Architecture

## Overview
EcoCatalyst is structured as a monorepo with two main components:
1. **Mobile Application** (React Native)
2. **ML Package** (TensorFlow Lite models and scripts)

## System Architecture

### Mobile Application (React Native)
The mobile application follows a layered architecture:

#### Presentation Layer
- **Screens**: UI components representing full application screens
- **Components**: Reusable UI components
- **Navigation**: Screen navigation and routing

#### Business Logic Layer
- **Services**: Business logic and API integrations
- **Contexts**: React contexts for state management
- **Hooks**: Custom React hooks for shared functionality

#### Data Layer
- **Firebase Integration**: Authentication, Realtime Database, Cloud Storage, Analytics
- **Local Storage**: AsyncStorage for local data persistence
- **API Clients**: Interfaces for external services

### ML Package (TensorFlow Lite)
The ML package is organized into:

- **Models**: TensorFlow Lite models for:
  - Object recognition
  - Barcode scanning
  - Product classification
  - Diet recommendation

- **Scripts**: Python scripts for:
  - Model training
  - Data preprocessing
  - Model conversion (TensorFlow to TensorFlow Lite)
  - Model evaluation

- **Data**: Training and test datasets

## Key Components

### Product Sustainability Scanner
- Camera integration for barcode scanning and object recognition
- TensorFlow Lite models for object detection
- Product database integration
- Sustainability scoring algorithm

### Eco-Friendly Alternative Suggester
- ML-based recommendation engine
- Product alternatives database
- User preference learning

### Carbon Footprint Tracker
- Carbon footprint calculation models
- Analytics dashboard
- Data visualization components
- Goal setting and tracking

### AI-Based Diet-Plan Chatbot
- NLP model for understanding user queries
- Diet recommendation engine
- Conversational UI

### Gamified Achievements
- Achievement system
- Progress tracking
- Rewards and badges

## Data Flow
1. User interacts with the mobile application
2. Application captures data (scans, user input, etc.)
3. Data is processed locally using TensorFlow Lite models
4. Results are displayed to the user
5. Data is stored locally and/or in Firebase
6. Analytics data is sent to Firebase Analytics

## Security Architecture
- Firebase Authentication for user management
- Data encryption at rest and in transit
- GDPR compliance measures
- Secure local storage

## Performance Considerations
- On-device ML processing to reduce latency
- Efficient data structures and algorithms
- Optimized React Native components
- Lazy loading of resources
- Offline caching
