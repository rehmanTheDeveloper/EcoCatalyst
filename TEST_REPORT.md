# EcoCatalyst Testing Report

## Overview
This report documents the testing process for the EcoCatalyst mobile application during Sprint 7-8 (testing phase). The testing focused on verifying that all features are aligned and working seamlessly together.

## Application Structure
The EcoCatalyst app is a React Native application with the following core features:
1. **Authentication System** - Login, registration, and password reset
2. **Product Sustainability Scanner** - Barcode and object scanning for sustainability information
3. **Carbon Footprint Tracker** - Tracking and visualization of carbon footprint data
4. **AI-Based Diet-Plan Chatbot** - Sustainable diet recommendations
5. **Gamified Achievements** - Rewards for sustainable actions

The app uses a context-based state management system with the following providers:
- AuthProvider - Authentication state management
- FootprintProvider - Carbon footprint tracking
- ProductsProvider - Product scanning and alternatives
- DietProvider - Diet recommendations
- GamificationProvider - Achievement tracking
- PreferencesProvider - User preferences
- ThemeProvider - UI theming

## Testing Approach
The testing approach included:
1. **Code Review** - Examination of the codebase structure and implementation
2. **Unit Testing** - Testing individual components and functions
3. **Manual Testing** - Testing the app's UI and functionality
4. **Integration Testing** - Testing how features work together

## Testing Environment Setup
- React Native with Expo
- Jest for unit testing
- Firebase for authentication and data storage
- Manual testing using Expo Go

## Test Results

### 1. Authentication System

#### Features Tested:
- User registration
- Login
- Password reset
- Authentication state persistence

#### Findings:
- The authentication flow is well-implemented with proper error handling
- Firebase integration is configured but using placeholder values
- The AuthContext provides a comprehensive API for authentication operations
- Error messages are user-friendly and specific to different error scenarios

#### Issues:
- Firebase configuration uses placeholder values and needs real credentials
- Unit tests for AuthContext have configuration issues with Jest mocking

### 2. Product Sustainability Scanner

#### Features Tested:
- UI for barcode and object scanning
- Camera integration

#### Findings:
- The scanner UI is well-designed with options for barcode and object scanning
- The ProductsContext provides methods for scanning and retrieving product data

#### Issues:
- The actual scanning functionality is not fully implemented
- Integration with a product database is needed for real sustainability data

### 3. Carbon Footprint Tracker

#### Features Tested:
- Footprint data entry and storage
- Summary calculations
- Category breakdown
- Data visualization

#### Findings:
- The FootprintContext provides comprehensive functionality for tracking carbon footprint
- Data is stored both locally (AsyncStorage) and in the cloud (Firebase)
- Summary calculations include daily, weekly, monthly, and yearly totals
- Category breakdown is well-implemented

#### Issues:
- Firebase integration uses placeholder values
- Some UI elements in the FootprintScreen are static and not connected to real data

### 4. AI-Based Diet-Plan Chatbot

#### Features Tested:
- Chat interface
- Response generation

#### Findings:
- The chat interface is well-designed and user-friendly
- Basic response generation is implemented based on keywords

#### Issues:
- The chatbot uses predefined responses rather than a real AI model
- Integration with a more sophisticated NLP model would improve the feature

### 5. Gamified Achievements

#### Features Tested:
- Achievement tracking
- Progress visualization

#### Findings:
- The GamificationContext provides methods for tracking achievements
- Basic UI for displaying achievements is implemented

#### Issues:
- Achievement criteria and rewards need more definition
- Integration with other features (scanner, footprint) is not fully implemented

### 6. Integration Between Features

#### Findings:
- The context providers are properly nested in the component hierarchy
- Data sharing between features is possible through the context system
- The HomeScreen shows integration of data from multiple features

#### Issues:
- Some features are not fully integrated (e.g., scanner results don't affect footprint)
- Data flow between contexts could be more explicit

### 7. Testing Infrastructure

#### Findings:
- Jest is configured for unit testing
- Some component tests are implemented
- Test coverage is low (estimated <10%)

#### Issues:
- Jest configuration has issues with mocking React Native components
- Many components and contexts lack unit tests
- Integration tests are missing

## Recommendations

### 1. Authentication System
- Replace Firebase placeholder values with real credentials
- Add more comprehensive unit tests for AuthContext
- Implement user profile management

### 2. Product Sustainability Scanner
- Implement actual barcode scanning functionality
- Integrate with a product database for sustainability information
- Add unit tests for scanning logic

### 3. Carbon Footprint Tracker
- Connect UI elements to real data from FootprintContext
- Implement more sophisticated data visualization
- Add unit tests for summary calculations

### 4. AI-Based Diet-Plan Chatbot
- Integrate with a more sophisticated NLP model
- Implement personalized recommendations based on user preferences
- Add unit tests for response generation

### 5. Gamified Achievements
- Define clear achievement criteria and rewards
- Implement integration with other features
- Add unit tests for achievement tracking

### 6. Testing Infrastructure
- Fix Jest configuration issues
- Increase test coverage to the target 80%
- Implement integration tests for feature interactions

### 7. General Recommendations
- Implement error boundary components for better error handling
- Add loading states for asynchronous operations
- Improve accessibility compliance
- Implement comprehensive input validation

## Conclusion
The EcoCatalyst app has a solid foundation with well-designed UI components and a comprehensive state management system. However, there are several areas that need improvement, particularly in the implementation of core functionality and testing infrastructure. By addressing the issues and recommendations outlined in this report, the app can achieve its goal of providing a seamless and effective tool for promoting sustainable choices.

## Next Steps
1. Address the Jest configuration issues to enable comprehensive unit testing
2. Implement real functionality for features that currently use placeholder data
3. Increase test coverage to the target 80%
4. Implement integration tests for feature interactions
5. Conduct user testing to validate the user experience
